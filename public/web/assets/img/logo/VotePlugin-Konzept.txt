**TOPLIST PLUGIN:**

**General:**
- Admin has to approve every server before its shown
- Every Added / Edited Server has to be approved by an Admin
- User can add multiple servers
- Email should be sent if an Admin has to approve anything
- A Wizard to add a server is might be a good idea (Step 1 = Server-Details | Step 2 = Server Description | Step 3 = Votifier)

**Shortcode:**
ItÂ´s the hearth of the System
- Should be responsible
- Look nice
- Have Filters for Gamemodes / Server Language
- Should be a WP Shortcode

**Admin Panel:**
- Serverlist to view, edit, filter, ban, approve Servers from User
- Toplist Configuration:
 - How often can be voted per User / IP / other Identifiers
 - Reset interval (Amount of days - 0 if never)

**User Panel:**
- User Serverlist - Show all servers and offer Edit / Delete 
- Site to add Server

**Votifier:**
- User should be able to add a webhook / callback on Vote so he can give their user credits to buy something in store

**Server-Description:**
A User should be able to add a post / description for his Server, which also has to be approved by the Admin.

*Alternative*: Add a input field while adding server where a google docs link is required

- A button to vote for a server shall be there
- Infos of Server should be visible there

**Future ideas:**
- Auction System to bid for Placement
